# Rainfall - Level0 Walkthrough

A single binary is present in `/home/user/level0`. Listing it shows it is owned by `level1`. Copy it locally for analysis:

```bash
scp -P 4242 level0@{IP}:/home/user/level0/level0 .
```

Open the binary in Ghidra, locate `main`, and inspect the argument check. When the program is executed with the argument `423`, it first say to identify us as the level1 identity, then it spawns a shell:

```bash
./level0 423
```

Use that shell to read `/home/user/level1/.pass`.
