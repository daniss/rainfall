# Rainfall - Level0 Walkthrough

A single binary is present in `/home/user/level0`. Listing it shows it is owned by `level1`. Copy it locally for analysis:

```bash
scp -P 4242 level0@{IP}:/home/user/level0/level0 .
```

Open the binary in Ghidra, locate `main`, and inspect the argument check. When the program is executed with the argument `423`, it first say to identify us as the level1 identity, then it spawns a shell:

```bash
level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 423
$ whoami
level1
$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a
```

Use that shell to read `/home/user/level1/.pass`.
